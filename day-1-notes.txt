1- javascript introduction 
    
javascript is used to create dynamic client side pages. It is an object based scripting language which is lightweight and crossplatform.
javascript translator translate the javascript code to the browser.

javascript is light weight object oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting  the webpages.
it is an interpreted , full fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity in websites when applied to the HTML document.
It has no connnectivity with JAVA. it is case sensitive.

inside HTML document JS code is writtin inside 
internal = 
<script document="text/javascript">
let a = 10;
</script>
external = <script source="index.js"> //IMPORTANT = the index.js should be in same folder</script>

2- variables 
Variables are containers for storing data.
we can use var , let , const.
 a - VAR is a function-scoped or globally scoped variables.
 b - LET is block scoped variables
 c - CONST is block scoped local variables. Once the value is assigned we cannot change it during the runtime 

TDZ= Temporal dead zone 
it is the time between the let and const is hoisted and when it is actually initialized. During this time you cannot access the variable
and if you will you will get the ReferenceError


DATA TYPES-
Data types define the data type that a variable can store. javascript incluedes primitive and non-primitive data types.
the primitive data types in JS inclues string, number, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol. the non primitive data type includes the object.

primitive data type is a data that is not an object and has no methods or properties .
    a- string
    b- number
    c- bigint
    d- boolean
    e- undefined
    f- symbol
    g- null

All primitives are immutable, that is, they cannot be altered

OPERATORS 
operators are symbols that perform operations on values and variables
 1- Arithmetic operators
    a- + , - , / , * , %, **, ++, --
    it will perform some mathematical operations , to add, multiply, division, subtraction, remainder,
 
 2- Assignment operators
    a- =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= etc
 
 3- Comparison Operators
    a- ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
 
 4- Logical Operators
    a- && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)

 5- Ternary Operator
    a- condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

 6- Type Operators
    a- typeof, instanceof
