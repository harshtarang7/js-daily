CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

//////////////

IF = it is a statement to specify a block of JS code to be executed if a condition is true. the keyword should be in lower case
if(condition){
//code to be executed if condition is true
}

if(hour<18){
    greeting = "good day";
}
it will return good day if the time is less than 18 

/////////////////////////////////////////

ELSE = we will use the else statement with if to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
if(condition){
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}else{
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}

good day 


ELSE-IF = we will use this statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false;

if(condition1){
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
}else if (condition2){
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}else{
    // block of code to be executed if the conditon1 is false and condition2 is false
}

if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
it will execute code according to time and the conditon


loops
FOR LOOP = It is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition.
It contains initialization , condition and increment/decrement in one line

for(initialization; condition; increment / decrement){
    // you code here 
}

example= for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){
    console.log("loop")
}
it will return 5 times "loop" string in console

WHILE LOOP = the while loops creates a loop that is executed as long as a specific condition is true.
we specify the condition before the loop, and usually , some variable is incremented or changed in the while loop body to determine when the loop should stop.

while(condition){
    //code block is to be executed
}

let a = 0;
while(a<=3){
    console.log("Hello World")
    a++;
}
it will print the code block "hello world" as long as the condition is less than or equals to 3
it will start from 0 till 3 and runs 4 times (0,1,2,3). after the 4th iteration , a will be 4 and the condition would become false so the loop will exit.

DO-WHILE loop = it is a statement used to create a loop that executes a block of code once, then it will check the condition is true , and then repeats the loop
as long as the condition remains true.
it is used when the loop body needs to be executed at least once . The loop ends when the condition is false.

do{
    //code to execute
}while(condition)
